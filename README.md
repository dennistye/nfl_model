# 🏈 NFL Match Predictor

This project uses historical NFL play-by-play and box score data to build a logistic regression model that predicts the probability of a home team winning upcoming matchups. The model is deployed using a Flask web app.

## 📊 Features

- Cleans and combines multiple seasons of play-by-play and box score data
- Engineers features like:
  - Win rate
  - Points scored and allowed
  - Yardage metrics
  - Completion rates
  - Turnover rates
- Builds a logistic regression model with cross-validation
- Predicts the probability of a home win for 2025 Week 1 game
- Exposes results through a Flask web app and `week1_predictions.csv`
